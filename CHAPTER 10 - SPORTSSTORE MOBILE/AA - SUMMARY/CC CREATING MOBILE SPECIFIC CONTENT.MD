# CREATING MOBILE SPECIFIC CONTENT

In the previous section, we saw the *Responsive Design* has the following characteristics:  
1. Same content to all devices;
2. Css is used to found out how the content should be presented
3. This process doesn't involves server-side of the applications
4. All devices is treated as being variations on the same client basic theme

The alternative approach is to use server to analyse the client's browser and return different views to different clients. For this alternative approach the Mvc framework supports a feature called *Display Mode* to create different views based on the client. In this section we will use a simpler form of display mode to handle mobile devices using *JQuery Mobile library*.

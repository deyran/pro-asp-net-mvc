# CREATING MOBILE SPECIFIC CONTENT

Responsive design delivers the same content to all devices and uses CSS to figure out how that content should be presented, a process that doesnâ€™t involve the server-side part of the application and which assumes that you want to treat all devices as being variations on the same basic theme. An alternative approach is to use the server to assess the capabilities of the client browser and send different HTML to different kinds of client. This works well if you want to present a completely different aspect of the application on the desktop to, say, a tablet.

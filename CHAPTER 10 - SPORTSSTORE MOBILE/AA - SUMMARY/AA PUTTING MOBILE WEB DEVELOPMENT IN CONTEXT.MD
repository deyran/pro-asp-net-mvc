Mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) have become an everyday accessory for millions of people, investing in mobile web applications is the way to increase the users of our web apps. But delivering mobile web apps is harder than delivering desktop web apps, this activity require planning, design and testing.

The MVC framework is a server-side framework, that's means it receives HTTPS requests and generating a HTML responses, therefore the feature set for MVC framework to handle the mobile client is limited. To deal with the limitations of the MVC framework we have three strategies for dealing with the mobile client (we will see in this chapter), these strategies are:
<ol>
	<li>Doing nothing (or as little as possible)</li>
	<li>Using responsive design</li>
	<li>Creating mobile specific content</li>		
</ol>

It may seem like an odd idea to do nothing, but some mobile devices are capable of handling content that has been developed for desktop clients. Many—admittedly the most recent—have high-resolution, high-density displays with plenty of memory and browsers that can render HTML and run JavaScript quickly. If your app isn’t too demanding, you may find that many mobile devices won’t encounter any problems at all displaying your application content. As an example, Figure 10-1 shows how an iPad displays the SportsStore application without any modifications.

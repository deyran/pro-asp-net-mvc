The MVC Framework does have some features that can help with mobile development. But the MVC Framework is a server-side framework that receives HTTP requests and generates HTML responses and there is a limited amount it can do to deal with the wide variation in capabilities that you will encounter when targeting mobile clients. The degree to which The MVC Framework can help depends on the mobile strategy that you have adopted. There are three basic mobile web strategies you can follow, which I describe the following sections.
	1 - MVC -> SOME FEATURE -> MOBILE DEVELOPMENT
	2 - THE MVC FRAMEWORK IS A SEVER-SIDE FRAMEWORK, JUST ONLY RECEIVES HTTPS REQUESTS AND GERENRATING HTML RESPONSES
	3 - THERE IS A LIMITED AMOUNT -> DEAL -> MOBILE CLIENT
	4 - THERE ARE THREE POSSIBILITIES DO FOLLOW
		4.1 - DOING NOTHING
		4.2 - USING RESPONSIVE DESIGN
		4.3 - CREATING MOBILE SPECIFIC CONTENT

The MVC framework is a server-side framework, that's means it receives HTTPS requests and generating a HTML responses, therefore the feature set for MVC framework to handle the mobile client is limited. To deal with the limitations of the MVC framework we have three strategies to handle the mobile client: 1 - Doing nothing (or as little as possible); 2 - Using responsive design; 3 - Creating mobile specific content

Mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) have become an everyday accessory for millions of people, investing in mobile web applications is the way to increase the users of our web apps. But delivering mobile web apps is harder than delivering desktop web apps, this activity require planning, design and testing.
<br /><br />

<h1><div align="center">PUTTING MOBILE WEB DEVELOPMENT IN CONTEXT</div></h1>
The MVC framework is a server-side framework, that's means it receives HTTPS requests and generating a HTML responses, therefore the feature set for MVC framework to handle the mobile client is limited. To deal with the limitations of the MVC framework we have three strategies for dealing with the mobile client (we will see in this chapter), these strategies are:
<ol>
	<li>Doing nothing (or as little as possible)</li>
	<li>Using responsive design</li>
	<li>Creating mobile specific content</li>		
</ol>

Some mobile devices are capable of handling desktop web applications,they have some characteristics like:
<ol>
	<li>High-resolution;</li>
	<li>High-density display</li>
	<li>Plenty of memory</li>
	<li>Browsers that can handle HTML and run JavaScript quickly</li>
</ol>
 With those characteristics it's not necessary modify anything or almost nothing to run the web applications. As an example, Figure 10-1 shows the <i>Device Mode (Chrome DevTools)</i> to approximate how the SportsStore application looks and performs on a mobile device with dimensions of with 1200w x 800h.

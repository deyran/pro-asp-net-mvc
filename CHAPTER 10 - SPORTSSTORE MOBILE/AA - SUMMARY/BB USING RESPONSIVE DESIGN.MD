	Using responsive design
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Responsive design creates web pages that automatically adjust to different screen sizes and viewports (the area your web page is drawn on). To make pages ability change automatically, HTML and CSS features are used to change the content layout based on the screen width	
	</li>
	<li>
		In this book our priority is study the MVC framework, so we will only see a demonstration of how the technique can be applied. The library that will be used is the Bootstrap library to style the SportsStore application.
	</li>
	<li>
		In the next sections, we will apply the Responsive design feature on the main part of the app so that it is visible in Chrome device Mode with dimensions of 305w x 639h, as Figure 10-2 shows.

<h2><div align="center">CREATING A RESPONSIVE HEADER</div></h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		We start with the page header, which contains the SportsStore name, the cart summary, and the Checkout button. Open the _Layout.cshtml file and edit to match as Listen 10-1.

		Run the app and see the results for the SportsStore brand, the visible-xs and hidden-xs classes were used to switch to text on two lines that will be shown vertically when the window size is less than 768 pixels

<h2><div align="center">CREATING A RESPONSIVE PRODUCT LIST</div></h2>
We will now display a product list on narrow devices! To make this possible, the category buttons will disappear. Open the _Layout.cshtml File, open and edit it to match in Listing 10-3

There can only be one call to the RenderBody method in a layout. I get into the details of layouts in Chapter 20, but the effect of this limit is that I canâ€™t have duplicate sets of elements that I show and hide, each containing a RenderBody call. Instead, I need to change the layout of the grid that contains the RenderBody method call so that the elements in the layout adapt around the content from the view.

One of the reasons that I used the Bootstrap grid to structure the content in the _Layout.cshtml file in Chapter 7 is that it includes some responsive design features that let me work around the RenderBody limitation. The Bootstrap grid layout supports 12 columns and you specify how many an element will occupy by applying a class, like this, which is how I applied the Bootstrap classes in Chapter 7:

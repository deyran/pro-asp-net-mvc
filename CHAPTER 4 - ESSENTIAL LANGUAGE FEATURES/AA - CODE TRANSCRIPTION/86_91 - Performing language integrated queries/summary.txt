    LINQ is a SQL-LIKE syntax for querying data in classes

>>>> Listing 4-27. Querying without LINQ in the HomeController.cs file -> 86
    With LINQ, I can significantly simplify the querying process, as you can see in Listing 4-28

>>>> Listing 4-28. Using LINQ to query data in the HomeController.cs file -> 87
    This style of LINQ is known as "query syntax" [...]. The wrinkle in this query is that it returns one anonymously typed object for every Product in the array that I used in the source query

>>>> UNDERSTANDING DEFERRED LINQ QUERIES -> 90
>>>>>>>> Listing 4-30. Using deferred LINQ extension methods in a query in the HomeController.cs file -> 90
    A query that contains only deferrd methods is not executed until the items in the result are enumerated, as demonstrade by Listing 4-30

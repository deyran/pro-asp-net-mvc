<ul>
  <li>
    The most important goal of this chapter is to build a simple yet realistic e-commerce application
  </li>
  <li>
    The project from chapter 6 (named SportStore) will be used.
  </li>
  <li>
    These features will be implemented:
    <ol>
      <li>Online product catalog that customers can brower by category and page</li>
      <li>Users can add and remove product</li>
      <li>Checkout where customers can enter their shipping details</li>
      <li>An administration area (CRUD - create, read, update and delete) - facilities for managing the catalog</li>
      <li>To prevent misuse, only logged in administrators can make changes</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>In this chapter, the focus is on the MVC Framework, database integration and other things will be simplified</li>
  <li>The topics in this chapter are just an introduction that will be seen on other chapters</li>

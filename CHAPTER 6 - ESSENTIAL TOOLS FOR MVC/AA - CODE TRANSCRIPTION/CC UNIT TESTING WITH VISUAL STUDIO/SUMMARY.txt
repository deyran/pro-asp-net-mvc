CC UNIT TESTING WITH VISUAL STUDIO -> 137
    In this book, the test package that will be used is NUnit due to integration with the rest of the IDE. To demonstrate this support, a new implementation of the IDiscountHelper interface will be created, and it will be called MinimumDiscountHelper.cs. As seen in Listing 6-26
        
        >> Listing 6-26. The contents of the MinimumDiscountHelper.cs -> 137

    The MinimumDiscountHelper.cs class is not yet implemented, The Test Driven Development (TDD) approach of writing the unit test will be used and only then will the code be implemented

CCAA CREATING THE UNIT TEST PROJECT -> 137
    >> Figure 6-4A. Creating the unit test project
        1 - Right-click on the top level on the Solution "EssentialTools".
        2 - Add -> New Project.
        3 - In the first select component (All language), choose "C#".
        4 - In the second select component (All platforms), you don't need to change anything at all.
        5 - In the third select component (All project types), choose "Test".
        6 - Choose the project templates called "Unit Test Project (.Net Framework)".
        7 - Click on the Next button.

    >> Figure 6-4B. On the "Configure your new project" screen, follow these steps:
        1 - Set the project name to "EssencialTools.Tests"
        2 - Click on the Create button
    
    >> Figure 6-5. Adding a reference to the MVC project -> 138
        It's necessary to give the test project a reference to the application project so that it can access the classes and perform tests upon them.
            1 - Right-click the References item for the EssentialTools.Tests project;
            2 - Add Reference from the pop-up menu.
            3 - Click Solution in the left panel
            4 - Check the box to the EssentialTools    

CCBB CREATING THE UNIT TESTS -> 139
    >> Listing 6-27. Adding the Test methods to the UnitTest1.cs file -> 139
        >>>> A class that contains tests is annotated with the TestClass attribute. 
        >>>> Individual tests are methods annotated with the TestMethod attribute.
        >>>> Methods without TestMethod attribute Visual Studio will not treat it as a unit test

    >> Listing 6-28. Defining the Remaining tests in the UnitTest1.cs file -> 141

CCCC RUNNING THE UNIT TESTS (AND FAILING) -> 142
    Test Explorer window => To managing and running tests, follow these steps:
        1 - Select Wintows > Test Explorer
        2 - Click Run All
        3 - See the results shown in Figure 6-6    
        
        >> Figure 6-6. Running the tests in the project -> 143

    >> IMPLEMENTING THE FEATURE -> 143

CCDD TESTING AND FIXING THE CODE -> 144
    >> Figure 6-7. The effect of implementation the feature with a bug -> 144
        A deliberate error was left to demonstrate how iterative unit testing with VS works and you can see the effect of the error if click the Run all button in the test. (See Figure 6-7)

    > This Razor code block allows to include C# statemants in a view. 
    > Razor views are compiled into C# class in an MVC application and the base class that is used defines the Layout property
    > When the Layout property is set to null tells the MVC framework that the view is self-contained and will render all the content required for the client.

>>>> CREATING THE LAYOUT -> 100

    #NOTE -> File in the Views folder whose names begin with an underscore (_) are not returned to the user, which allows the file name to differente between views that you want to render and the files that support them. Layouts, which are support files, are prefixed with an underscore.

        > The call to the @RenderBody method inserts the contents of the view specified by the action method into layout markup
        > The elements in the layout will be applied to any view that uses the layout and this is why layouts are essentially templates

>>>> APPLYING A LAYOUT -> 102
    To apply the layout to the view, I just need to set the value of the Layout property.

>>>> USING A VIEW START FILE -> 102
    > There is a big problem to be solved, for each view that I want to specify the layout file. If I need to rename the layout file, I must to find all the view files that refer to it.
    > I can resolve this by using a View start file

            1 - If your view is self-contained and do not want to use a layout, then set the Layout property to null.
            2 - If you omit the Layout property, then the framework will use a layout, it will use the View Start file

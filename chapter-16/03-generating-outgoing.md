## Generating outgoing URLs in Views

In MVC applications, the user navigates from one view to another. A static link is used for the first view that targets the action method that generates the second view, as can seen in the code below.

```
<a href="/Home/CustomVariable"> This is an outgoing URL</a>
```

The HTML element creates a simple and quick link to CustomVariable action method on the Home controller. Although simple and quick, hard coded links can be dangerous when changes are needed. All application links must be updated one by one.

The **Routing System** is the alternative to hardcoded link, defining the **URL scheme** to generate outgoing URLs dynamically.

### Using the routing system to generate an outgoing URL

To generate an outgoing URL in view open the */View/Shared/ActionName.cshtml* file, edit it to match in Listing 16-2.

<p align="center">
    <img src="ch16-Pictures/Listing 16-2.png" /><br />
    <b>Listing 16-2.</b> Using the Html.ActionLink helper method in the ActionName.cshtml file
</p>  

As seen in Listing 16-2, **Html.ActionLink** was used to create a link. Run the application and see the result in Figure 16-1.

<p align="center">
    <img src="ch16-Pictures/Figure 16-1.png" /><br />
    <b>Figure 16-1.</b> Adding an outgoing URL to a View
</p>  

The HTML that the ActionLink method generates is based on the current routing configuration. In the example seen in Figure 16-1, the URL scheme was defined in Listing 16-1 generating this HTML:

```
<a href="/Home/CustomVariable">This is an outgoing URL</a>
```

The benefit of this approach is that it automatically responds to changes in the routing configuration. As a demonstration, open the RouteConfig.cs file and edit it to match Listing 16-3:

<p align="center">
    <img src="ch16-Pictures/Listing 16-3.png" /><br />
    <b>Listing 16-3.</b> Adding a route to the RouteConfig.cs file
</p>

The new route changes the URL schema, and it can be seen from the HTML generated by the ActionLink HTML helper method as follows:

```
<a href="/App/DoCustoVariable">This is an outgoing URL</a>
```

As can be seen, changing the routing scheme changes automatically the outgoing of views. Not only that, when the link is clicked, it target to the action method correctly, as shown in Figure 16-2:

<p align="center">
    <img src="ch16-Pictures/Figure 16-2.png" /><br />
    <b>Figure 16-2.</b> The effect of clicking on a link is to make an outgoing URL into an incoming request
</p>

#### UNDERSTANDING OUTBOUND ULS ROUTE MATCHING

* Routes defines URL scheme, changing routes will change URL Scheme.
* Routing System processes routes in the order that they were added to the *RouteCollection* object (RegisterRoutes method)
* Each route is inspected to check whether to match or not
* The route system doesn't attempt to find routes that provides the best matching route. It finds the first match and use the route to generate the URL; Any subsequent routes are ignored
* The most specific route must be defined first
* If no matching route is attempted to create a link, a link will be created with an empty href, as shown in the code below.

```
<a href="">About this application</a>

```

### Targeting other controllers

To create an outgoing URL that target a different controller, an overload method that lets you specify the name of the controller, as shown in Lising 16-4.

<p align="center">
    <img src="ch16-Pictures/Listing 16-4.png" /><br />
    <b>Listing 16-4.</b> Targeting a different controller in the ActionName.cshtml file
</p>  

When the view is rendered, the following HTML is generated:

´´´
<a href="/Admin">This targets another controller</a>
´´´
The URL generated was expressed as **/Admin** by the ActionLink method. This is because the routing system knows that the defined route uses the Index action method by default, omitting unnecessary segments.

## Generating outgoing URLs in Views

In MVC applications, the user navigates from one view to another. A static link is used for the first view that targets the action method that generates the second view, as can seen in the code below.

```
<a href="/Home/CustomVariable"> This is an outgoing URL</a>
```

The HTML element creates a simple and quick link to CustomVariable action method on the Home controller. Although simple and quick, hard coded links can be dangerous when changes are needed. All application links must be updated one by one.

The routing system is an alternative to defining the URL scheme to generate outgoing URLs dynamically.

### Using the routing system to generate an outgoing URL

### Targeting other controllers

### Passing extra values

### Specifying HTML attributes

### Generating fully qualified URLs in links

### Generating URLs (and not links)

### Generating Outgoing URLs in action methods

### Generating a URL from a specific route

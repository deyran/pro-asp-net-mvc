    CHAPTER 07 - SPORTSSTORE - A REAL APPLICATION
</h1>

## GETTING STARTED
* To start this journey, it's necessary to create a *Visual Studio Solution* that contains three projects: 
    1. Domain Models
    2. MVC Application
    3. Unit Tests

To get started, I created a new
Visual Studio solution called SportsStore using the Blank Solution template, which you can find in the Other Project Types/Visual Studio Solutions section of the New Project dialog, as shown in Figure 7-1. Click the OK button to create the solution.

### CREATING THE VISUAL STUDIO SOLUTION AND PROJECTS
### INSTALLING THE TOOL PACKAGES
### ADDING REFERENCES BETWEEN PROJECTS

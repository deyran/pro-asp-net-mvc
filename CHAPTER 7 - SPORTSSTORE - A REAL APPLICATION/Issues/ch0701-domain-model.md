DOMAIN MODEL

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model#:~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20a%20domain,grounded%20in%20a%20description%20logic.  

In Software Engineering, domain model is a conceptual model that represents both behavior and data. This formal representation of the knowledge domain contains, in a description logic, the following aspects: Concepts, Roles, Datatypes, individuals and rules.

# Overview

A domain model is a system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a sphere of knowledge, influence or activity (a domain[3]). 
    DOMAIN MODEL > SYSTEM OF ABSTRACTIONS > SELECTED ASPECTS > KNOWLEDGE, INFLUENCE OR ACTIVITY
    A domain model is a system of abstraction of selected aspects of knowledge, influence or activity

The model can then be used to solve problems related to that domain.
    The model is used to solve domain problems.

The domain model is a representation of meaningful real-world concepts pertinent to the domain that need to be modeled in software. 
    THE DOMAIN MODEL > REPRESENTATION OF CONCEPTS > DOMAIN > MODELED > SOFTWARE
    The domain model is a representation of concepts belonging to the domain that need to be modeled in software
    
The concepts include the data involved in the business and rules the business uses in relation to that data. 
    THE CONCEPTS > DATA IN THE BUSINESS > RULES THE BUSINESS > RELATONS
    The concepts are about the data, business, rules and their relationships between them

A domain model leverages natural language of the domain.
    THE DOMAIN MODEL > NATURAL LANGUAGE > DOMAIN
    The domain model uses the domain's natural language
----------------

A domain model generally uses the vocabulary of the domain, thus allowing a representation of the model to be communicated to non-technical stakeholders. It should not refer to any technical implementations such as databases or software components that are being designed.

In Software Engineering, domain model is a conceptual model that represents both behavior and data. This formal representation of the knowledge domain contains, in a description logic, the following aspects: Concepts, Roles, Datatypes, individuals and rules.

# Overview
    A domain model is a system of abstraction of selected aspects of knowledge, influence or activity. The model is used to solve domain problems. The domain model is a representation of concepts belonging to the domain that need to be modeled in software. The concepts are about the data, business, rules and their relationships between them. The domain model uses the domain's natural language
----------------

A domain model generally uses the vocabulary of the domain, thus allowing a representation of the model to be communicated to non-technical stakeholders. It should not refer to any technical implementations such as databases or software components that are being designed.

In Software Engineering, domain model is a conceptual model that represents both behavior and data. This formal representation of the knowledge domain contains, in a description logic, the following aspects: Concepts, Roles, Datatypes, individuals and rules.

# Overview

A domain model is a system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a sphere of knowledge, influence or activity (a domain[3]). 
    DOMAIN MODEL > SYSTEM OF ABSTRACTIONS > SELECTED ASPECTS > KNOWLEDGE, INFLUENCE OR ACTIVITY
    A domain model is a system of ab44straction of selected aspects of knowledge, influence or activity

The model can then be used to solve problems related to that domain.
    The model is used to solve domain problems.

The domain model is a representation of meaningful real-world concepts pertinent to the domain that need to be modeled in software. 
    THE DOMAIN MODEL > REPRESENTATION > DOMAIN > MODELED > SOFTWARE
    The domain model is the representation of the domain concepts that needs to be modeled in software.

The concepts include the data involved in the business and rules the business uses in relation to that data. 

A domain model leverages natural language of the domain.
----------------

A domain model generally uses the vocabulary of the domain, thus allowing a representation of the model to be communicated to non-technical stakeholders. It should not refer to any technical implementations such as databases or software components that are being designed.

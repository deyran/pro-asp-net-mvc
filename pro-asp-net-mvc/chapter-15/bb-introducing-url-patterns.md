## Introducing URL Patterns
P1====================
* The routing system works its magic using a set of routes. 
* These routes collectively comprise the URL schema or scheme for an application, which is the set of URLs that your application will recognize and respond to.

P2====================
* I do not need to manually type out all of the individual URLs I am willing to support in my applications. 
* Instead, each route contais a URL pattern, which is compared to incoming Urls. 
* if a URL matches the pattern, then it is used by the routing system to process that URL, Let's stat with a URL for the example application:

http://mysite.com/Admin/Index

P3====================
* URLs can be broken down into segments. 
* These are the parts of the URL, excluding the hostname and query string, that are separated by the / character. 
* In the example URL, are two segments, as showni in Figure 15-3.
Figure 15-3. The segments in an example URL

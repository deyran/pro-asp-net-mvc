# Debugging MVC Applications
The purpose of debugging is to identifying a problem, isolate the source of the problem and then fix the problem or determine a way to work around it.

In this section, you will see the basics of Visual Studio debugger operations like set up the debugger and perform different debugging activities on your MVC project.

## Preparing the Example Project
* To demonstrate using the debugger create a new *Solution* called *DebuggingDemo*, with *MVC project* using *MVC project template*, configuring *Individual User Accounts authentication* option, which sets up a basic user security system, as shown in Figure 14-3.

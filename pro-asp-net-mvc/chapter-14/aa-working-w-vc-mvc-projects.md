    Chapter 14: Overview of MVC Projects
</h1>

The purpose of this chapter is to present an overview of the MVC Framework features, following these items:
1. Structure and nature of an ASP.NET MVC application.
2. Default projects structure and naming conventions
3. some of which are optional and some of which are hard-coded into the way that the MVC Framework operates.  

# Working with Visual Studio MVC Projects
When you create a new ASP.NET project, Visual Studio gives you a number of choices as to the initial content you want in the project. 
    New ASP.NET project > number of choices > initital project

The idea is to ease the learning process for new developers and apply some time-saving best practices for common features and tasks. 
    What's the propose? 

This support continues with templates used to create controllers and views that are created with template code for listing data objects, editing model properties and so on

# Working with Visual Studio MVC Projects
Visual Studio IDE has a set of tools and libraries that are used to build applications with basic initial functionality, settings and directory and file structures. These tools and libraries, as known as *frameworks*, avoid repetitive tasks and optimize work by letting the developer focus on the project in hight level of functionality of the project. This support continues with templates used to create controllers and views that are created with template code for listing data objects, editing model properties and so on.

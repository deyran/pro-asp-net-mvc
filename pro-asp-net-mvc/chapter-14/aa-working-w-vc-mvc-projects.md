    Chapter 14: Overview of MVC Projects
</h1>

The purpose of this chapter is to present an overview of the MVC Framework features, following these items:
1. Structure and nature of an ASP.NET MVC application.
2. Default projects structure and naming conventions
3. some of which are optional and some of which are hard-coded into the way that the MVC Framework operates.  

# Working with Visual Studio MVC Projects
To create a new ASP.NET project, it is necessary a set of choices to configure the template for the project. As a result of these initial steps, the project starts with basic code and structure. The ideas behind this approach are: 1 - Learning process for beginners; 2 - A time-saving best practices for common features and tasks.

With Visual Studio and MVC, Microsoft has updated the *templates* and *scaffolding*, as it is known, to blur the boundaries between different kinds of ASP.NET project and to provide a wider range of project templates and code configurations.




--------------------------
One of the characteristics I like most about ASP.NET and the MVC Framework is just how much flexibility I have in tailoring the platform to suit my development style, and the projects, classes and views that Visual Studio creates and populates make me feel constrained to work in someone else’s style. I also find the content and configuration too generic and too bland to be useful. 


In Chapter 10, I mentioned that one of the dangers of using responsive design to target mobile devices is a kind of averaging that ends up compromising the experience for all devices, and something similar has happened to the Visual Studio templates. Microsoft can’t possibly know what kind of application you need to create and so they cover all the bases, but in such a drab and generalized way that I end up just ripping out the default content anyway.

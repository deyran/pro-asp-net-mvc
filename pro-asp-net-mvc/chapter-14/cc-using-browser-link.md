# Using Browser Link
P1--------------
* Visual Studio 2013 includes a feature called browser link that allows you to view the application in multiple browsers simultaneaously and have them all reload when you make a change.
* This feature is most useful once an application has stabilized and you are doing fit and finish work on the HTML and CSS that your views generate (I'll explain why shortly)

P2--------------
* To use browser link, click on the small down arrow next to the selected browser on the Visual Studio toolbar and select Browser With from the menu, as shown in Figure 14-17.

P3--------------
* The Browse With dialog window will appear.
* Hold the control key and select the browser that you want to use.
* In Figure 14-18, you can see that I have chosen Internet Explorer and Chrome.
* You can also use this dialog to add new browsers (although Visual Studio is pretty good at detecting most of the mainstream ones).

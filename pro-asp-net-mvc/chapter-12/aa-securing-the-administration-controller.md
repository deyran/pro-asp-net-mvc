# SportsStore: Security & Finishing Touches
In this chapter, the following features will be implemented:
1. Authentication requirement to access SportsStore administration (previously implemented in the previous section).
2. Once authentication is ok, support for adding product image will be implemented.

## Securing the Administration Controller
ASP.NET authentication and authorization features are packages that function as general purpose system for keeping track of who is logged in.

### Creating a Basic Security Policy
* Configuring forms authentication is one of the ways users can be authenticated in an ASP.NET application. Open the Web.config file to match with the Lising 12-1 (SportsStore.WebUI project).

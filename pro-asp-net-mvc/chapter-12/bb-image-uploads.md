# Image Uploads
In this section, the SportStore user experience will be increased with addition of these features:
1. Upload product images
2. Store these images in the database
3. Displaying these images in the product catalog

## Extending the Database 
1. Open the Visual Studio Server Explorer window and navigate to the Products table in the database created in Chapter 7. 
    Visual Studio > Server Explorer Window > Product table

2. The name of the data connection may have changed to be EFDbContext, which is the name assigned to the connection in the Web.config file.
    Data connection > EFDbContext > Same name assigned in the Web.config file

3. Visual Studio is a little bit inconsistent about when it renames the connection, so you might also see the original name that was shown when the connection was created. 

4. Right-click on the Products table and select New Query from the pop-up menu and enter the following SQL into the text area:

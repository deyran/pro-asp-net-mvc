    CHAPTER 11 - SPORTSSTORE - ADMINISTRATION
</h1>

In this chapter, we will add new features to the SportsStore application that will make it possible to manage the product catalog. These are the features that will be implemented in this chapter:
1. Create, read, update and delete (CRUD) product repository item.
2. Uploading and displaying images alongside products in the catalog.

## ADDING CATALOG MANAGEMENT
* CREATING A CRUD CONTROLLER  
    * To start this journey we will create a new controller (*SportsStore.WebUI project*) for the SportsStore administration by following these steps:
        1. Right-click on the Controllers folder. 
        2. Select *Add > Controller* from the pop-up menu.
        3. Select *MVC 5 Controller â€“ Empty* from the list of options, click add button.
        4. Set the name to *AdminController*, click add button.
        5. Edit the content to match with the Listing 11-1.

                <b>Listing 11-1.</b> The Contents of the AdminController.cs File
            </p>        

    * The controller constructor declares a dependency on the IProductRepository interface, which Ninject will resolve when instances are created

    * UNIT TEST: THE INDEX ACTION  
        * The focus in this test will be on the index method (AdminController.cs) if it correctly returns the Products objects from the repository. 
        * The test will work like this:
            1. Creating a mock repository
            2. Comparing the test data with the data returned by action method.
        * Create a new test file (*SportsStore.UnitTests* project) called *AdminTests.cs*, edit the content to match with the Listing 11-1A.

                <b>Listing 11-1A.</b> The Contents of the AdminTests.cs File
